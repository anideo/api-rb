Ruby SDK for the [Outside.in API](http://developers.outside.in/)

## Prerequisites

### Mashery account

To make API requests, you need a [Mashery](http://mashery.com/) account that has been approved for use with the OI API. See the "Get Started" section of [developers.outside.in](http://developers.outside.in/) for more information on how to set up your account.

### Dependencies

Gem dependencies are managed with [Bundler](http://gembundler.com/). Install them like so:

    $ bundle install

## Usage

TBD

## CLI

A set of Thor tasks is provided so that you can call API methods from the command line (read more about Thor at [http://github.com/wycats/thor](http://github.com/wycats/thor)).

The following examples assume you have Thor installed system-wide. If it's local to your bundle, then replace `thor` with `bundle exec thor`.

You can see all available OI tasks with this command:

    $ thor list oi
